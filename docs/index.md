# EDAF Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms Framework (EDAF).

This documentation is divided into the following sections:

*   [Getting Started](./getting-started.md): Learn how to build and run the framework.
*   [Architecture](./architecture.md): Get a high-level overview of the framework's architecture and the design patterns used.
*   [Configuration](./configuration.md): Understand the configuration file format and all the available options.
*   [Algorithms Reference](./algorithms.md): Detailed descriptions of all implemented algorithms, their parameters, use cases, and complexity analysis.
*   [Metrics and Results](./metrics-and-results.md): Comprehensive guide to accessing and interpreting metrics, events, and results.
*   [Extending the Framework](./extending-the-framework.md): Learn how to add your own custom components, such as problems, algorithms, and genotypes.
*   [Framework Improvements](./improvements.md): Analysis of current framework state and proposed improvements.
